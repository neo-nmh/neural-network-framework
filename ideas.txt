TODO: init data


bad design:
when creating the network, all layer sizes and layer input sizesmust be entered in manually and correctly


ideas:
chain rule vs error formulas for backprop
should refactor backpropogation code?
look into weight initialization
look into implementing batches


changes made:
cleaned up functions.py
added tanh
just realized that sigmoid cant be negative so thats why it doesn't work
sin approximation works
