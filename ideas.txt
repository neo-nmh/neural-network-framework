TODO: init data


bad design:
when creating the network, all layer sizes and layer input sizesmust be entered in manually and correctly


ideas:
chain rule vs error formulas for backprop
should refactor backpropogation code?
look into weight initialization
look into implementing batches


changes made:
added cross entropy loss meaning no need to calculate jacobian for softmax
added print statements
added nothing function
trying to approximate sine function
