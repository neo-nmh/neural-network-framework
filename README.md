A neural network framework built from scratch - EPQ year 12/13 project

- Initializes and trains neural networks / convolutional neural networks
- No deep learning libraries used
- Allows for adjusting hyperparameters and architecture
- Backpropagation

I made this project to teach myself the core ideas behind deep learning.
